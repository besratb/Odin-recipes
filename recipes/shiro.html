       <h4>Introduction</h4>
       <p>Shiro is the staple of Ethiopian food - its quick to make and, typically served fresh after being cooked. 
        Spread on the base of Injera it can be a a filling meal commonly shared in a group.</p>

        <h4>Ingredients:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Chickpea or Bean powder</li>
            <li>Clarified butter or Oil</li>
            <li>Traditional spices(Berbere)</li>
            <li>Salt & Pepper</li>
            <li>Onions, Garlic, Ginger and occasionally crushed tomatoes</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Steps:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Start by pureeing the onions in the blender.      </li>
            <li>Dump the onion mush into a hot dry skillet (I love my cast iron skillet for this!) Stir frequently until the water evaporates and the onions start to get just a tiny bit of light brown color.</li>
            <li>Once the onions begin to color a bit, add 1/2 cup oil and some berbere.</li>
            <li>My girls use at least 1/4 cup of berbere for this recipe.</li>
            <li>If you like your food milder, you can start with less, them taste and see how it seems to you.</li>
            <li>Let the onion and the berbere cook in the oil for a minute or two.</li>
            <li>Puree one tomato. Add pureed tomato to the skillet and cook for a minute or two. Be careful as you add the tomato, as the oil will spit at you.</li>
            <li>Before you add the shiro powder, make sure that you have a couple of cups of water close by. Add your shiro powder gradually, stirring briskly with a wooden spoon or a wire whisk. It will pretty quickly get very thick and 'pop'.</li>
            <li>Once the shiro seems pretty well mixed into the oil, add a couple cups of water. Stir well. The mixture will thicken as it cooks. You can turn your heat down to medium at this point.</li>
        </ol>
